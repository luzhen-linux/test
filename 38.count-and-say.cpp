 *
 * The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five
 * terms as following:
 * 
 * 1.     1
 * 2.     11
 * 3.     21
 * 4.     1211
 * 5.     111221
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
 * 11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
 * 21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Given an integer n, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a
 * string.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: 1
 * Output: "1"
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: 4
 * Output: "1211"
