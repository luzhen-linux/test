 * 
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest
 * consecutive elements sequence.
 * 
 * 
 * For example,
 * Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
 * The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its
 * length: 4.
 * 
 * 
 * Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
