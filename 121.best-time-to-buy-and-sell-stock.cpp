 * Total Submissions: 653.2K
 * Testcase Example:  '[7,1,5,3,6,4]'
 *
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given
 * stock on day i.
 * 
 * If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one
 * and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum
 * profit.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
 * Output: 5
 * 
 * max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger
 * than buying price)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
